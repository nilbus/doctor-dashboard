        bin/build-war

    or

        rvm use jruby                               # use JRuby and its gems for packaging
        bundle install --deployment                 # prepare gems for deployment
        RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile # compile assets (js, css)
        bundle exec warble                          # generate the war file
        bundle install --no-deployment              # allow gems to be modified
        rvm use default                             # use standard Ruby for development
